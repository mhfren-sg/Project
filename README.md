# Model Prediction and Link Analysis for HDB Datasets
Model Prediction and Link Analysis for HDB Datasets  
This project focuses on analysing HDB resale price data through two components: Model Prediction and Link Analysis.  
The goal is to explore data patterns, build predictive models, and uncover insights within the HDB dataset.

# Project Structure
The repository contains three main folders:

1. Jupyter Notebooks  
This directory includes the main analysis notebooks.  
Model_Prediction.ipynb – Covers Model Prediction Tasks I and II, including preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.  
Link_Analysis.ipynb – Covers Link Analysis Tasks I and II, focusing on network relationships and connectivity patterns within the dataset.  
To run the notebooks, install all required Python packages listed in requirements.txt.

2. Slides  
This folder contains presentation slides summarising the findings.  
Model_Prediction_Slides.ppt – Slides explaining Model Prediction Task I.  
Link_Analysis_Slides.ppt – Slides covering Link Analysis Tasks I and II.

3. Data  
The Data directory contains the datasets used in this project, including:  
HDB resale price  
HDB Resale Price Index

# Getting Started
Clone this repository.  
Navigate to the project directory.  
Install dependencies using (in terminal):  pip install -r requirements.txt  
Open and run the Jupyter notebooks to reproduce the analysis.
